Here are some instructions to execute the program properly:

1) The main file to execute is “Model.py” 

2) When executing the file, ensure that the serial port of the computer is receiving data and that its name match the one used in the program -> at the top of the “Data_acquisition.py” file.

3) In the same file as 2), one can choose the baudrate used for the serial transmission.

4) At the top of the main file “Model.py”, one can also set the calibration time. During this period, the user should make some mouvements to calibrate the IMUs and contract the muscles at its maximum to calibrate the EMGs.

5) Always at the top of the main file, one can choose the number IMUs and EMGs used for the simulation.

6) Finally, the program is ended by pressing the “esc” key of the keyboard.
